If  police are called for a false alarm, house owners might need to pay a fine for dispatching police unnecessarily. A self-monitored home limits the capacity for subsequent penalties and incorrect alarms.</p>

There's no latency so you get alerted instantly so you can take immediate actions such as activating a loud alarm, contacting the authorities, or using the camera's two-way audio system to talk to the prospective burglars.</p>
