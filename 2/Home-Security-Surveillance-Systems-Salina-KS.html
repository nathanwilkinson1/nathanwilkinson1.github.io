<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is better when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies every time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
