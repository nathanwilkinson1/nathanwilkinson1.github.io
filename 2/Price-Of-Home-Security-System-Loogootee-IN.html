Then you go into the WiFi details of the network you're attempting to connect to. Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to transmit the WiFi details.

The majority of cameras with taping abilities have an integrated secure digital (SD) or microSD slot that allows for sufficient recording space. When the sd card is complete, you'll need to erase footage or shop it elsewhere. Some popular cameras immediately override expired videos, which may not be most perfect if you need to keep a video.
