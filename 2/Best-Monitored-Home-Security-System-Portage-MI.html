As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely normal given that the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
