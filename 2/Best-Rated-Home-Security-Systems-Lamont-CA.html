The cameras will be monitored by the Jefferson County Metro Location Criminal offense Center The license plate acknowledgment camera data will be uploaded to the FBI's Crook Justice Details Services, and the city will acquire the material from the FBI's website.

<p>Although 1080p is normally the standard resolution for cameras we've checked, there are benefits to models with higher-resolution sensors.
