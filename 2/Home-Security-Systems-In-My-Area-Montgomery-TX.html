<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.

Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
