If alarm use resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less break-ins across a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident. However, the reality that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute significantly to authorities ability to capture robbers makes the underwriting of alarm response by authorities and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers support police reaction to alarmed properties) a inefficient and costly technique to theft reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
