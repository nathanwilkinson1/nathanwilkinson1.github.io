<p>The very first wireless function to think about is the security system and its elements, and how they all connect. In the past, every monitoring part was hard-wired back to a panel box. This indicated every door and window needed its own wire and path of holes through your house. Wireless systems use radio frequencies that are only effective up to a certain radius. You will need a system that has a long reception variety and can manage a more significant amount of info and signals if you have a big home. Remember: A home bigger than 4,500 square feet is usually much better off utilizing a wired system.</p>
