This builds in increased protection and a fail safe should a door blow open or a bird rattle an outside window.</p>

Convenience is the significant reason people switch to wireless," states Du, and it's tough to refute a 10-minute setup when the wired choice needs professional installation of wires beneath your house.

The main control needs to be centrally located in your house and have full-time non-switched Air Conditioning power. Wired alarm systems are extremely reputable and you don't have to fret about their battery running out. However, they are fixed in location, may require professional installation, and they're not portable.</p>
