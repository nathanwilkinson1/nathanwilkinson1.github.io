<p>The NVR eliminates these issues, since it is instead linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, typically by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely because they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.

The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
