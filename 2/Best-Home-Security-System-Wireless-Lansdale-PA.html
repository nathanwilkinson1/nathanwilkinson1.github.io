<p>Storage: Cloud storage (where video is minimized a remote server run by the producer, instead of at your house) is the standard these days, however some cameras store recordings in your area on a microSD card or a connected hard disk.

Usually, consumer-grade cameras are developed to work well when there is a lot of readily available light, and when the lighting becomes low or absent (think sundown or nighttime), their pedigree starts to show. Commercial cameras surpass their less expensive cousins due to the fact that they have larger internal video sensors and higher-quality parts that can adapt and capture outstanding low light video.</p>
