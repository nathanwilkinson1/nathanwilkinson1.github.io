<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
