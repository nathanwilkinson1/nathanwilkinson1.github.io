<h2>Home Security Cameras, Home Security Systems Altoona</h2>
<p>There's a lot that goes into a typical CCTV video surveillance system. While the cameras get the majority of the attention in the beginning, you also have other issues, such as viewing, recording, and archiving the video footage, and the equipment required for performing those tasks. Here's a take a look at the basic elements of a common CCTV system. We have a CCTV Security Pros IP Camera & NVR system at our church. We started with 16 cameras & have actually grown to 25 cameras. When we needed to add new cameras or fix concerns, Tim in Tech Assistance has actually been really useful. He is very patient with those of us that don't have know-how in the IP world. Tim comprehends what excellent customer support is all about. This company supports their products.</p>
<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, since it is rather connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the exact same network, normally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will be compatible with a given video recorder before buying.</p>
<p>You check out that right. We have actually had the exact same monitoring rate considering that 1978. That's over 42 years! We've NEVER raised our standard monitoring rate, and no other home security company in Houston can say the very same. How do we do it? Smith Thompson Home Security not only offers outstanding service, we don't raise our rates. So, our customers are extremely faithful! We know we will earn their business at their next home, and they'll inform family and friends.</p>
