<p>Twenty-five years earlier, general and business interactions were mostly simultaneous. To accomplish almost anything, somebody live" needed to be on the other side of the table or telephone line, especially when handling worldwide and national business.

Typically, CCTV is most reliable as an active system, with a security guard monitoring the passages and another person, somewhere, enjoying video surveillance displays for assistance. Whatever is synchronized and everything happens in real time.</p>
