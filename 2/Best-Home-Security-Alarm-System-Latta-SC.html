<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we could point them at the exact same spot and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had set up on the patio by a licensed electrician (who happens to be my other half).

Utilizing an enough time random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly selected words) makes pre-shared crucial WPA virtually uncrackable.
