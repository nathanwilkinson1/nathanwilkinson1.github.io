<p>While IP cameras are normally more expensive than their analog equivalents, the total cost of a full IP system tends to be a little lower than that of a similar analog system.

<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
