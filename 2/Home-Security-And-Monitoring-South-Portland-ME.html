<p>As an incentive to buy an alarm system, a number of companies provide "complimentary monitoring services" for the very first few months.

There's numerous wireless security cameras to pick from and we barely scratched the surface area of what sort of cameras are out there.

While it's more pricey than most other cameras, the general quality of the Arlo Pro 3 helps make up the difference in cost.</p>
