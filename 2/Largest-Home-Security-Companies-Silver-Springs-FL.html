As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has actually explained, "understanding that you are being seen by armed federal government representatives tends to deter things. You don't want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "individuals might find out to be cautious about the regulars and books they read in public, avoiding titles that might alarm hidden observers. They might likewise put more believed into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang hookers, drug addicts or members."
