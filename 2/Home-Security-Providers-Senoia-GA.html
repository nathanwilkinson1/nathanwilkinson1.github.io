<p>So, while alarm might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security bundle, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the community ought to take on a share of the cost. If alarm use led to enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms led to much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less robberies across a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more evident. Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute substantially to cops capability to capture intruders makes the underwriting of alarm response by authorities and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers support cops action to alarmed properties) a expensive and inefficient  approach to theft decrease across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
