<p>Absolutely nothing is more vital than securing what you treasure most ... your family and home. The foundation of a home security system is the base station. This unit is what interacts with all of the security sensing units and smart-home parts in your house. Many link to a home router, however if yours has Wi-Fi or cellular support, positioning is more flexible. Contact sensing units are the first thing you ought to buy together with the base station; these attach to windows and doors and will notify you when they open.

<p>At night, though it does not have the complete IR LED variety of some competitors, the Arlo catches enough light to see a good distance, and there's an adjustable spotlight readily available if you're putting it outdoors - which nicely brings us to the great motion detection.
