<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or totally wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our testing, must provide a minimum of a number of months of operation on a charge (depending on use). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers seven days of free cloud storage (with more readily available for a regular monthly charge ). However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo states will allow the camera to correctly identify motion and not get stuck taping on a loop. That also saves battery life, however it may leave you with tape-recording spaces throughout important security events.
