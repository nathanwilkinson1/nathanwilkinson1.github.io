<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, many burglar alarms work the specific very same method. They use open and closed circuits to move an electrical present. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which suggests if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the alarm system.
