<p>TP-Link's Kasa Camera Outdoor (KC200) has 1080p images and a 130-degree field of view that might rival a few of our top choices. It likewise comes with 2 days of totally free cloud storage (with an option for more ), which can cram in clips of as much as 3 minutes. However, we had a handful of tests where recordings eliminated in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second spaces in between clips. Protective Systems uses a touch-screen control board and keypads, different sensing units (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes.

<p>Nearly 100 surveillance cameras-- 24 PTZ cameras, 17 dome cameras, and 54 license acknowledgment cameras are being set up on 64 power poles in Birmingham, Alabama. The cameras will be monitored by the Jefferson County City Area Crime Center The license plate acknowledgment camera data will be uploaded to the FBI's Wrongdoer Justice Info Services, and the city will acquire the content from the FBI's portal.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
