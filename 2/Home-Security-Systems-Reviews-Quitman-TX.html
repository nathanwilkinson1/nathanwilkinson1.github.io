The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
