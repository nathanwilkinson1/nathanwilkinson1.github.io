<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
