When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching.

Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
