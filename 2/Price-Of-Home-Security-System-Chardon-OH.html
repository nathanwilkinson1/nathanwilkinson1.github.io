<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a harmful enemy, given that the disturbance of the network avoids the circulation of information and really indirectly protects information by avoiding it from being transferred. The typical reason for performing a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, throughout which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, providing an opportunity for the destructive enemy to record these codes and utilize different breaking tools to analyze security weaknesses and exploit them to gain unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can introduce a dictionary style attack of "perhaps accepted" security secrets based on the "model" security key captured throughout the network healing.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely regular because the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients recognize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
