<p>Since the glass real estate does not get in the way, they aren't rather as vandal-proof as dome cameras, but they make up for it in capabilities. As well as being terrific for re-positioning on the fly, they are much better for low-light and infrared considering that the glass real estate does not restrain the lens. With some, it's hard to tell at a glance where they have actually been intended, so they can offer a panoptic impression as a deterrent, despite their true field of vision.

Surveillance cameras are likewise manufactured in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. There are some tricky consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not constantly better.</p>
