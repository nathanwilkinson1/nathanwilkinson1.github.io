<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, typically described as shock sensing units, are different in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
