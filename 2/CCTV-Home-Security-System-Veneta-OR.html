The Wyze Cam can also record video to the cloud, but the totally free account is limited to 12-second clips every 5 minutes. That indicates the camera will wait 5 minutes before it's able to tape-record once again, which suggests you might be missing out on a lot. Wyze's just recently launched Complete Motion Capture resolves this issue for $1.50 monthly per camera. It makes it possible for recording of all motion the camera senses, for up to five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and quickly starts another, with no gaps in between. Recordings are simple to find under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the membership, you still get the limited cloud recording and microSD recording, but we don't recommend that for home security because if it's taken, you don't have a backup.</p>

Then, the monitoring company instantly sets to action, getting in touch with you and informing the authorities.</p>
