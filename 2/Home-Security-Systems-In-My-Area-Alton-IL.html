<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security professionals investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for among our top areas. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can record up to 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, however entries were often missing, in spite of showing up in the app's activity timeline. With basic wise home gadgets like automated door locks, you can stay in bed and check that you locked your doors.

All of these cameras can be integrated into the general system so the home can be monitored by video from anywhere. To understand how home wireless security systems work, some basic understanding of alarm systems is useful.
