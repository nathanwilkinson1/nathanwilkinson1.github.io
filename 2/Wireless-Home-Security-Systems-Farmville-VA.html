If there are lots of cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the footage is going to consume storage space quickly.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
