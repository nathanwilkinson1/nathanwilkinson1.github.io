<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system.

Both the initial Home system and the Home Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only model we tested that also deals with HomeKit.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing.
