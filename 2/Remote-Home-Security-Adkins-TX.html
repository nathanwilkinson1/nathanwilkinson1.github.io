ADT doesn't have the greatest customer care credibility amongst the companies we considered, racking up more than 3,000 problems on its Better Business Bureau page While we chalked most of this up to the truth that ADT has several million more customers than its competitors, our tester started his call with low expectations.</p>

We have not evaluated Eufy's security cameras yet so we'll take your tip into factor to consider. We truly like the Eufy video doorbell, so I imagine we'll test the security cameras soon. SimpliSafe is not terrific at wise home assistance. It works with Amazon Alexa, and it uses its own wise door lock, but you can't go setting up lots of third-party gadgets with your SimpliSafe system. It does not deal with Z-Wave or IFTTT, and we do not expect it to include additional functionality anytime soon.</p>
