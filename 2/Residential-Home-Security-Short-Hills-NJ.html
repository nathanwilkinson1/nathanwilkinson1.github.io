Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan choice.

<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 delivers totally free benefits like person detection, familiar-face notifies, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage starts at $5 each month.)

Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 annually) to save 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing out on, thanks to irregular and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>There's a few other cool features in the camera itself such as an automated zoom which tracks moving things if it detects an intruder; an useful intercom function that enables the device to act as a clever doorbell (although it does not have a chime or button - for that you'll need the Nest Hi doorbell ); and, because Alphabet owns Nest, the camera carries Google Assistant.
