<p>The hermetically sealed reed switch is a really common kind of 2 piece sensor that runs with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either typically open or generally closed when under the influence of a magnetic field as in the case of proximity to the second piece which contains a magnet. When the magnet is moved far from the reed switch, the reed switch either closes or opens, once again based on whether the style is usually open or generally closed. This action coupled with an electric present (generally at 12V DC) enables an alarm control board to find a fault on that zone or circuit.

<h3>Monitored Home Security in Colorado</h3>
<p>Many full-time" homeowners with alarm systems tell us that they are home all the time" and question why they would require monitoring. However, individuals need to consider the frequency and period of their absences from home or business - instead of simply their tenancy. Who is home, when they are not?

<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the exact same area and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather.

All of the cameras were connected to the very same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router indoors (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
