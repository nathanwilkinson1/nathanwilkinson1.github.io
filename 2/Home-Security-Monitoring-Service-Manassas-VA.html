<p>On the surface area, these 2 camera classifications might appear comparable, though if you were able to see inside, the distinctions end up being distinct and obvious.

Here is what this suggests, by method of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image across a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
<p>Unlike wired security systems, wireless systems allow for on-the-go" monitoring of your system from a cellular phone - anytime, anywhere. Almost every security camera we took a look at supports file encryption. This protects the camera's information stream (like videos of your kids after school) from prying eyes.
