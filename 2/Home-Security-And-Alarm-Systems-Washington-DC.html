<h3>Security And Alarm Companies in Washington DC</h3>
<p>so say you have a camera that somebody can see it they would shoot it if they had a gun so I suggest to have cameras built in to a house that will be pertected by cameras. Box cameras provide an apparent indication for anyone who goes by that they are being taped on CCTV and this can be a great deterrent of theft and criminal activity. Whereas dome cameras are smaller and more discreet. These compact cameras are perfect for monitoring a larger location such as your front or back garden and can follow motion with ease.</p>
