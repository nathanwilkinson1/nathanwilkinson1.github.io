Nevertheless, the reality that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute significantly to authorities ability to capture intruders makes the underwriting of alarm action by cops and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers subsidize authorities action to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a inefficient and costly approach to robbery reduction throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
