<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against theft, fraud, and vandalism. Tip: Frequently keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. We must once again react to the alarm; each action is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one way of getting rid of expensive false alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a specific level, you can make it instantly shut off the heating unit.
