Since it does not have wires that can be cut, it also makes your camera more tamper-proof. Sadly I bought 4 cameras that look much like these, thinking I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the exact same camera. Boy was I wrong!! These cameras hold true 1080p and work completely right out of the box. They are well aligned and focused. The clearness is really terrific. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
