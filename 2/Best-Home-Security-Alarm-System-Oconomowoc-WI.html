<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring profound however subtle modifications to the character of our public areas. When residents are being enjoyed by the authorities - or aware they might be enjoyed at any time - they are more self-conscious and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has actually explained, "knowing that you are being enjoyed by armed federal government representatives tends to deter things. You don't want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he alerts, "people may find out to be mindful about the books and regulars they check out in public, preventing titles that might alarm unseen observers.
