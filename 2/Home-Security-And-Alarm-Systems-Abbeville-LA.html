<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally normal given that the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
