Like the Ping camera, the Vivint Outdoor Camera records 20-second clips. After we utilized the Anker EufyCam for nearly six months, we're shocked to report that it is on track to provide on its pledge of approximately one year of battery life.

A couple of models use batteries, making placement more versatile, but this needs other compromises, which we highlight in the Competitors area. Wi-Fi coverage likewise impacts where you position a camera: If you want to put a camera in a spot that does not get a good Wi-Fi signal, consider upgrading your router or including an extender or repeater. (For a take a look at our networking choices, see our guides to The very best Wi-Fi Router (for Many People)" and The Very Best Wi-Fi Extender and Signal Booster") It's a good rule of thumb that if your smartphone or laptop computer gets decent Wi-Fi reception in the area you wish to mount the camera, you likely won't have a problem.</p>
