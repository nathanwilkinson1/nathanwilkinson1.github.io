<p>Motion sensing units use backup protection in case a burglar manages to get into your home. However they only run when you're out of the house. When you're sleeping, don't believe they'll protect you if somebody gets in! Rather the opposite, your alarm system really disregards motion sensor signals if you equip the system but stay at home.
