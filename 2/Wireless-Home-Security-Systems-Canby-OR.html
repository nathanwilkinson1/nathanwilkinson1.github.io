<p>Thanks to current developments in innovation, wireless security systems are now as efficient as wired systems If you've decided to install an alarm system, you need to consider the following advantages of wireless innovation. For some, that might be worth the $300 price tag. However while we like the clever functions and home automation compatibility of the Nest Cam IQ, a lot of the cameras we took a look at offer the same benefits at a more affordable cost. Manage your home no matter where you are with the Vivint Smart Home app. Use your smartphone to speak and see with visitors at your door, see and safeguard packages, track activity with saved video, or interact with family at home.

Something else to keep an eye out for: All-in-one DIY security gadgets designed for smaller sized homes and living spaces. Essentially, just single-point, tabletop cameras packed with extra motion detectors and sensing units for things like temperature and ambient light, these gadgets can be a good fit for something like a studio apartment that does not have a garage door or many street windows to safeguard.</p>
<p>Another method to keep recordings on a non-analogue media is through the use of a digital video recorder (DVR).

So pick what will be the better deal for you. Go with the contract and enjoy those cost savings if you understand you'll stay put for at least 3 years. But if you may update to a new office with different security requirements, contract-free is your best option.</p>
