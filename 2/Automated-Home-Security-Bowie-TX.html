We like that the system consists of a wifi security camera and just informs you when motion is produced by something with the exact same heat pattern as a human (making sure there's no incorrect alerts). However, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get alerts on your phone if the sensing units have been activated.
