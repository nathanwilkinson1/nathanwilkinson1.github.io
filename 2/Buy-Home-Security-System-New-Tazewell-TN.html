<p>You would be hard-pressed to tell the difference between 1080p and 4K resolution when taking a look at a typical camera image. The one major benefit of 4K resolution is the capability to resolve detail after the fact, which suggests that users can zoom in on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution provides some advantages, it also brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are large and take up a great deal of tape-recording storage area.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions.
