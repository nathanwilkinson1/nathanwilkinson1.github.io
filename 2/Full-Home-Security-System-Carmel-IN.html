<p>The majority of surveillance cameras are fixed cameras-- they deal with simply one direction. PTZ cameras are from another location controlled, and allow the operator to pan (relocation left or best), tilt up and or down, or zoom better or farther away in order to follow people as they move. This lets operators zoom in on specific locations or track specific motions. The cameras can likewise run patterns or turn to a pre-programmed position.</p>

Because contract-based security systems typically do not come with in advance fees. Rather, the expenses are spread out over the length of the contract. We have actually seen 1-year, all the method approximately 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you don't want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting agreement (and who does?). Our choice: No agreement.</p>
