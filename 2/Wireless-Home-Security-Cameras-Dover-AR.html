<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the extremely idea of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long way, covering several decades. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation gradually developed into the highly advanced yet affordable systems offered today. The very first usages of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to tape video and watch it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to enhance the outcome of security systems.</p>
<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests potential culprits are less most likely to commit criminal activity if they think they are being watched or have a greater threat of being captured. This is also called the rational option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal offense avoidance technique, which argues that opportunities to offend can be minimized by altering a range of systems such as increasing the danger of a transgressor being captured, increasing the effort to commit the criminal offense, decreasing benefits from criminal offense commission, and decreasing provocations that generate criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This suggests that the culprit should understand the included surveillance for it to attain its desired result.</p>

<p>Nurse calling systems normally include emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the client's washroom. If a patient is having problem, he can push the button or pull the string and it will send an alert to the nurse station. This is a basic switch that is usually open or generally closed. The majority of your commercial security cameras consist of dry contact input ports to incorporate alarms and signals, sensing units, access control, and so on. My mind conceptualized a technique of not just providing the client with the patient-monitoring system but integrating it into their old nurse call station system.</p>
