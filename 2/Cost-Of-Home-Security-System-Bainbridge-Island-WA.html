<p>3 huge advantages of wireless security systems for renters are their expandability, mobility and impermanence. Tenants, unlike house owners, generally avoid making long-term modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't useful; they involve drilling into walls and installing long-term electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entranceways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensing units and other parts can easily be set up at various residential or commercial properties later on, and wireless systems are quickly expanded with new components too. Wireless security strategies also enable remote control of the system and basic home automation.

When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Generally, the most extreme frequencies produced are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the kind of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn produce an alarm condition.</p>
