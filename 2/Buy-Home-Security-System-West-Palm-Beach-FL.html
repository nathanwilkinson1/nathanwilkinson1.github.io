<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular given that the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as clients recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
