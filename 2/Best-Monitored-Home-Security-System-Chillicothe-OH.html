The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
