<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be utilized hardwired or totally wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our screening, should provide at least a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending upon usage). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that provides 7 days of complimentary cloud storage (with more readily available for a regular monthly fee ). However, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo states will allow the camera to appropriately discover motion and not get stuck tape-recording on a loop.
