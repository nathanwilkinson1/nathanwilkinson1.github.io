<h3>Home Security Monitoring in Kentucky</h3>
<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the exact same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much larger location and therefore uses fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this implies, by way of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image across a far bigger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
