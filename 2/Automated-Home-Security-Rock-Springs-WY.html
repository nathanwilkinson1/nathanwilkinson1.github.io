<p>Some wireless home security systems use a video recording storage choice and others do not. For the ones that don't, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home any time you access your system; nevertheless, nothing is tape-recorded. The systems with video storage normally include either a local storage or cloud storage choice. A local storage choice saves a pre-determined variety of video clips on the device itself. This alternative is typically cost-free. A cloud storage alternative saves your video clips in the cloud. However, this is normally a paid service and the number of hours it will store will depend upon how much cloud storage you are willing to pay for.</p>

The models we've examined so far either record really brief clips, leave huge gaps in between those short clips, or require charging on a regular basis.</p>
