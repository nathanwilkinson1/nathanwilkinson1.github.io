<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>

Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I checked, consisting of clever things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system.
