Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I checked, including clever things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system. But the Secure is pricey, extra sensors are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't include smoke alarm or camera backups-- is also expensive if you do not dedicate to a three-year agreement.</p>
