<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>

The app was likewise painfully slow when we accessed live streams and recorded clips, along with when we made changes in the settings.</p>
