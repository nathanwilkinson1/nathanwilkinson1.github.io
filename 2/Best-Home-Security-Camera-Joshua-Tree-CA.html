Because it uses infrared sensing units and mass detection to differentiate in between people and other inanimate objects or smaller living things, it only gets triggered when a human comes in close distance. You get a notification in your mobile phone app if your motion sensing unit is activated. There's no latency so you get alerted right away so you can take instant actions such as triggering a loud alarm, calling the authorities, or using the camera's two-way audio system to speak to the prospective trespassers.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
