<p>Our burglar alarms might be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to recognize a violation.

As soon as the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Going into the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and switching off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
