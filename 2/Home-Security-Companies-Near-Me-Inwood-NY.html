A lot of wired security systems have professional monitoring but do not have access to remote monitoring.

<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can communicate with your home network wirelessly, which can be handy for installation.

These cameras hold true 1080p and work perfectly right out of the box. They are well lined up and focused. The clearness is truly great. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, however still can see respectable after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
