Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals each time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
