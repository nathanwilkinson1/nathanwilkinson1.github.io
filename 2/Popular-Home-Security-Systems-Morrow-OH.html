<p>Discover how to design, build, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase staff member safety and decrease crime. The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image. In our screening, nevertheless, we discovered the motion sensor to be sensitive, with awful night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot.
