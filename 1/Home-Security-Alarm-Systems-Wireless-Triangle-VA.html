The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, however it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has a fantastic daytime image. In our screening, however, we discovered the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with terrible night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot.
