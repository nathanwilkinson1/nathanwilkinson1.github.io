<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise great metal building and construction.

Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
