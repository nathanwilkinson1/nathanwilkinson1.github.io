Home automation and control costs around $36.99 and video services come in at $52.99. Installation and other charges may use. Contractually, this is a 3-year agreement with a six-month trial.

<p>Nurse calling systems typically consist of emergency buttons or pull strings within the patient's restroom.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
