<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, scams, and theft. Recommendation: Often keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we need to again react to the alarm; each reaction is billed. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one way of eliminating costly false alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a certain level, you can make it automatically shut off the heater. If the motion sensors are triggered, you can automatically make the smart lights turn on to frighten possible intruders.</p>
