<p>CR's take: The Wyze Camera V2 is an excellent security camera and a remarkable worth. It gets an Exceptional ranking for video quality and is simpler to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of free storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to store video locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid membership plans for additional cloud storage. However the company does use a Complete Motion Capture service that continuously records for as long as motion is detected. Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is a pleasure to use too (a lot better than the apps you get with some spending plan security cameras), though if you want to get into its cleverest customisations, there is a little a learning curve.
