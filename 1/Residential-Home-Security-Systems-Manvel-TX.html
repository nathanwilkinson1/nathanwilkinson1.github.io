The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
