<p>When your video cameras are installed, you can choose whether or not your cameras will be monitored by the central station. If you choose to have your cameras monitored (this is typically provided for cameras that are monitoring outdoor areas), then yes, main station operators will see the video that is tape-recorded when an alarm is triggered. Nevertheless, you may select to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is generally done for cameras that are monitoring indoor, houses). Cameras that are not monitored by the central station can not be accessed our operators for any reason, even if asked for by the consumer.</p>
<p>While all strategies include the Frontpoint app, to open video surveillance and advanced smart tech functions, you'll need its $50-per-month Ultimate plan. That's a high rate for home automation when compared to competitors like Vivint, which lets you include those features at every tier (beginning at $40 each month). Think about purchasing a standalone security camera if you choose for a package that doesn't consist of live video surveillance.

<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can interact with your home network wirelessly, which can be handy for installation. Since it doesn't have wires that can be cut, it also makes your camera more tamper-proof. Unfortunately I acquired 4 cameras that look much like these, thinking I was going to save $14.00 per camera for the exact same camera. Young boy was I incorrect!! These cameras hold true 1080p and work perfectly right out of the box. They are well lined up and focused. The clearness is actually excellent. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
