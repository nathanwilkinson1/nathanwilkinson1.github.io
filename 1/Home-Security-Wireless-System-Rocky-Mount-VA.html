<p>A wired security system was the very first kind of security system that was invented for homeowners. It needs to be installed by an expert alarm installation team and, when installed, is difficult to move from one place to another. Wired systems are more typical for big residential or commercial properties and are often more costly than a wireless home security system. They can consist of outdoor cameras and an indoor camera similar to the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the team will need to rework the existing wires in your house. If you have actually currently installed a wired system in the past and you are upgrading to a new system, the team will be able to recycle the existing electrical wiring. However, if this is your first system, the alarm installation process can take upwards of 3 hours.</p>

In our screening, we paid particular attention to recording quality and length, frequency of signals, the app smart-home, user interface, and geofencing integration.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
