For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies developed their equipment this way to make consumers stay with them longer, since changing monitoring companies implies numerous dollars down the drain and a big headache for customers. How did they do it? They positioned 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their newest software application and firmware. According to the report, one gadget was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't say which device was the first, and the last to fall, though.</p>
