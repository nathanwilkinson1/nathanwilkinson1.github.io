The one significant advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to deal with detail after the fact, which suggests that users can focus on information such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. However, while 4K resolution uses some benefits, it likewise brings with it some downsides. 4K images are huge and use up a great deal of tape-recording storage area.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
