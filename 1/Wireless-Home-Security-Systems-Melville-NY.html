We tried each of the cameras in several areas around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet far from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we tested each camera utilizing an iOS gadget (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) in addition to an Android mobile phone (using a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie).
