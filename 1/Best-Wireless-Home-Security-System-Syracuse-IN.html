<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals every time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
