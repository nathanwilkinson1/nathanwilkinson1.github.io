Like any intrusive innovation, the benefits of releasing public video cameras should be stabilized versus the expenses and threats.

Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using 2 different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors located 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to replicate the issue. Although our testing shouldn't be taken as conclusive, we believe this concern is not likely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe customers who own the existing system.</p>
<p>We like the 10-piece Alarm Security Set because it consists of all the fundamentals (base station, keypad, motion sensor) plus a couple of additional entry sensors.

We've also tried to limit this list to cameras that can dish out signals that are trustworthy and really helpful - if your camera is pinging your phone whenever a leaf blows past, you're quickly going to get fed up with having to check it.</p>
