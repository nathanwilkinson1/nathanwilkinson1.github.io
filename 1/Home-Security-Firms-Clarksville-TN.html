<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a satisfaction to utilize too (a lot better than the apps you get with some spending plan security cameras), though if you wish to get into its cleverest customisations, there is a little bit of a knowing curve. For even more basic smarts, it's great, though. If you don't already have an Arlo camera or two in location, you're going to require to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all connect to the center (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can imply there are range concerns.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
