<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a satisfaction to utilize too (a lot better than the apps you get with some spending plan security cameras), though if you wish to get into its cleverest customisations, there is a little bit of a knowing curve. For even more basic smarts, it's great, though. If you don't already have an Arlo camera or two in location, you're going to require to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all connect to the center (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can imply there are range concerns.</p>
