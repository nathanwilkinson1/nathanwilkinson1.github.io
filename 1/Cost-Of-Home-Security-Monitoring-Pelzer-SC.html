The advantage is that-- if it's relatively modern and compatible-- you can keep the equipment you currently own rather than buy a completely new system.

<p>Due to the fact that it's more complicated than it needs to be, we do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, notifies, and combination all require different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we typically discovered action missing, thanks to irregular and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
