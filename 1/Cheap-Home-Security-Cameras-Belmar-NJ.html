<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
