<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>

There's a month-to-month monitoring charge that usually varies between $15-40 a month.</p>
