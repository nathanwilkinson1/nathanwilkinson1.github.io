<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
<p>Good image and I like that the cameras are white, they do not stand out excessive. Pretty simple to install.
