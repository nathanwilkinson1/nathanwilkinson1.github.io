<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal since the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as customers recognize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
