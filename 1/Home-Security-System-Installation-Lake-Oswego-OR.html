IP cameras can also be connected to what is referred to as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends data from the camera and supplies power to it. Analog cameras, on the other hand, require a switch to run the signal from the camera along with a separate power source, suggesting a more intricate setup and more wires. PoE switches are also normally considered as a more secure way to send data.</p>
<p>IP cameras are much greater resolution, allowing audio and video surveillance to be sent out over a network, with IP addresses designated to each camera. More technical in nature, IP camera systems will likely take more proficiency to setup, and generally cost more than analog cameras. All detectors and sensing units interact with a control board.

We tried each of the cameras in several locations around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we evaluated each camera using an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) along with an Android smart device (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie).

The offers of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance providers bring into question the appropriateness of the current trend in U.S. policing of allowing 3 or 4 totally free false alarms per calendar year, due to the fact that they offer no up-front incentives to motivate owners to avoid incorrect alarms.</p>
<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and typically over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trustworthy, but not compatible with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for further wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less electrical wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera independently, generally through 110VAC power.</p>
