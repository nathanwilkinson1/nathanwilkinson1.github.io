The infrared energy produced by an item is called its heat signature. In basic, the hotter a things is, the more radiation it discharges. A thermal camera consists of a heat sensor that is capable of discovering tiny differences in temperature. The device collects the infrared radiation from objects in the scene and creates an electronic image based on info about the temperature level distinctions.
