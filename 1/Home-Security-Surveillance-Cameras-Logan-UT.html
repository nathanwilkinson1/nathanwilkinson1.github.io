<p>So, while alarm systems may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a general security plan, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the community should carry a share of the cost. If alarm use led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms caused much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less break-ins throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more evident. However, the fact that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute considerably to authorities ability to capture burglars makes the underwriting of alarm action by police and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers subsidize police reaction to alarmed properties) a ineffective and expensive method to break-in decrease across an entire jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
