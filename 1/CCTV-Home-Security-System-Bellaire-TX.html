Motion detectors are a fantastic preventative function to add to your home security system due to the fact that they can alert you to the presence of an intruder before they make it into your house.

<p>Outdoor Camera - This weatherproof camera delivers smooth security video with a mix of hard circuitry and WiFi. It's motion-activated and has a speaker system, letting you send out voice cautions through your phone. The lens covers 140 degrees and lets you zoom in on the action. Like the Ping camera, the Vivint Outdoor Camera records 20-second clips. After we used the Anker EufyCam for almost six months, we're shocked to report that it is on track to deliver on its guarantee of approximately one year of battery life. What we do not love is that it leaves gaps in between recordings, which varied anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending upon the settings.

<p>The Canary is one of the largest cameras we evaluated, and it provides two-way interaction with its paid Canary Subscription. The cost of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent during our screening. The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces. And regardless of having an attractive rate and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has confusing cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 annually to the cost of an otherwise budget camera.</p>
