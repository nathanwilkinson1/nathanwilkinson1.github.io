The first guard arrived early so he might take a look at the whole area and speak with me about my issues. He was expert, very encouraging and polite. The second guard arrived in the middle of the night and took over. When I showed up in the morning to get the event started, he was also expert, courteous and encouraging. We were very delighted with your service and I will recommend that we call on your company next year for this event. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep. As soon as after leaving our property in your hands, I didn't fret.</p>
