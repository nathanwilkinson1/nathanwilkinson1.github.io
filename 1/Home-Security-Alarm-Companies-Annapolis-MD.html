<p>Pelco uses video surveillance cameras and video management options for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping centers, hotels, and others. Some people might state that we ought to not have surveillance cameras in public locations. They declare that they invade privacy. The argument here, however, is why be out in public if you want privacy? Surveillance cameras are indicated to keep you and other property safe, not to stalk you. When a criminal activity has been captured on film, cameras are there not to get into an individual's personal privacy however to safeguard the public by hindering criminal activity and by providing material evidence.</p>

<p>Reliability has actually long been at the heart of the dispute over hardwired versus wireless home security systems. It's an argument that's frequently skewed by elements such as uncertainty over the susceptibility of wireless systems, including disturbance from radio signals and problems that trigger incorrect alarms.

<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak to an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for optimal efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near to the NVR is certainly something to be taken into account. For instance if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a concern but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on 2nd story wall, this would cause an interruption in the signal.

<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big quantity of information required by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and typically over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cables are dependable, however not suitable with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for further electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera individually, usually through 110VAC power.</p>
