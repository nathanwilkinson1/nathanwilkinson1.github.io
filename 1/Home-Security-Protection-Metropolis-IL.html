<p>Cross-zoning is a strategy that does not require a new keypad. Using several sensing units to monitor activity in one area, software application analyses input from all the sources. For instance, if a motion detector trips in one location, the signal is recorded and the central-station monitor informs the customer. A 2nd alarm signal-- gotten in a nearby zone within a brief time-- is the confirmation the central-station monitor requires to request a dispatch immediately.
