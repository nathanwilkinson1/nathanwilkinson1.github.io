<p>We like that the Argus 2 includes a color night vision alternative, but the black and white variation can really be clearer and give you higher-quality video footage. This isn't really a huge offer considering the Argus 2's rate and all its other functions-- however for the record, stick to white and black. With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo clever service. But the coolest function is that you can charge it with the assistance of solar power with a solar panel battery charger.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
