Nevertheless, remember that the monitoring company's response time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls should be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.

Guidelines such as these are created to limit the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on false alarms. Numerous towns will fine you for too many false alarms.</p>

<p>Nurse calling systems generally consist of emergency buttons or pull strings within the client's toilet.
