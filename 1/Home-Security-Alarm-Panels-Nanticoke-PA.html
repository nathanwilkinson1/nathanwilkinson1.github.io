These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely regular given that the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody getting in the shop.
