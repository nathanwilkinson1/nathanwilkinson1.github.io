<p>Surveillance systems present police "bad apples" with a tempting chance for criminal abuse. In 1997, for example, a top-level authorities official in Washington, DC was captured using police databases to gather details on customers of a gay club. By looking up the license plate numbers of cars parked at the club and researching the backgrounds of the automobiles' owners, he tried to blackmail patrons who were wed. Picture what someone like that might do with a citywide spy-camera system.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, the majority of alarm systems work the exact very same way. They use open and closed circuits to move an electric existing.

Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the burglar alarm. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical present to flow throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the alarm system will trigger.</p>
