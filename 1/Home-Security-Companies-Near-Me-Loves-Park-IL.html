<h3>Burglar Alarm System Loves Park IL 61111</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually discovered that battery life never matches the manufacturer's stats because this originates from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest offender for short battery life without a doubt.
