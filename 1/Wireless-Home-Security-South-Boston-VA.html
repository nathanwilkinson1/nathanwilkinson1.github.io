<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens.

Inside, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
