In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls should be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires verification from a private security guard. Several cities also require a license to even operate a home and own security system. Guidelines such as these are developed to limit the time and resources that police and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Lots of towns will fine you for a lot of false alarms.</p>

In addition to the system itself, security alarms are frequently coupled with a monitoring service. In the event of an alarm, the facilities manage system contacts a main monitoring station. Operators at the station see the signal and take appropriate action, such as contacting property owners, notifying cops, or dispatching personal security forces. Such signals may be transmitted via dedicated alarm circuits, telephone lines, or the web.</p>
