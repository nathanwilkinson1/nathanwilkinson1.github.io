<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
