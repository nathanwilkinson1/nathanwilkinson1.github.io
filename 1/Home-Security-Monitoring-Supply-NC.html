<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Offered. ASecureLife's recommendation: Go to Sound for a well-priced Do It Yourself system that you can self-monitor or get professionally monitored for a small charge.

<p>No false alarm charges: House owners with a self-monitored system are less likely to dispatch the cops for a false alarm. Since the house owner is in charge of the system, police are just contacted if there's a genuine emergency.

If  authorities are called for a false alarm, homeowners might have to pay a fine for dispatching cops needlessly. A self-monitored home limits the capacity for incorrect alarms and subsequent penalties.</p>
