We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
