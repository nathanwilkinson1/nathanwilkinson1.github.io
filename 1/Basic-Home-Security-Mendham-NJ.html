<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak with an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimal efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera close to the NVR is definitely something to be thought about.

A wireless bridge is a great alternative for long range scenarios where poles and trees are not present.</p>
