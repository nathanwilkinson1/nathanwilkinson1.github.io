<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally regular given that the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers understand that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
