<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
