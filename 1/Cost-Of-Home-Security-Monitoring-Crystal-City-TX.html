<h2>A Secure Home Creates A Feeling Of Comfort And Safety Crystal City</h2>

Outdoor cameras must be weather resistant and in some cases, totally waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather condition resistance rating are the most resilient. Since their style allows for minimum glare, bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor options.

The cost of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent during our screening. The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent however good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
