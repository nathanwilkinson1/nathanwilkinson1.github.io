Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first question you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a couple of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived footage you plan to keep and for how long you prepare to keep recorded video. If there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the footage is going to eat up storage area quickly.
