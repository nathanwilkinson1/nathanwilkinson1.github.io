<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
