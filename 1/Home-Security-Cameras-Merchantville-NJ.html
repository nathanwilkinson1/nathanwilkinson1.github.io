The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image.

When it found any type of interference, SimpliSafe reacted with a statement saying the system would inform users. The company also questioned the video, claiming that there would need to be a perfect storm of circumstances for somebody to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing 2 different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units located 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to duplicate the problem. Although our testing should not be taken as definitive, we believe this problem is not likely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe customers who own the current system.</p>

Throughout testing, the siren fasted to sound when any of the sensors were activated and we like that the level of sensitivity of the motion sensing unit can be gotten used to account for family pets, too. The alarm is just one of 2 we tested that includes an external siren, and we're amazed that it also includes a dummy siren that can be connected to another external wall, further discouraging anybody from trying to break in to your residential or commercial property.

We also experienced above-average connection issues, with two Hive test units detaching 8 times over two months. Scout is very easy to utilize, particularly if you're a fan of mobile phones. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based web browsers, and it enables you to control nearly every element of the security system remotely, and it's extremely adjustable.
