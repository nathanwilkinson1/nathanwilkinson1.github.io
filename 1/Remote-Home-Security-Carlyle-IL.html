<p>This Arlo Pro 2 camera likewise functions as a motion detector. It is equipped with a PIR (Passive Infrared) Motion Sensor, so whenever there's some motion detected, it can send you a push notice in your phone so you can react to it immediately. Additionally, the motion sensor here is much more innovative than the ones supplied by adobe Starter Kit. Because it is a PIR motion sensor, it just gets set off when it captures motion from something giving off infrared energy, i.e., people and animals. Furthermore, it does not get activated by small things. As such, Arlo Pro 2 has one of the most innovative motion sensing units that remove all incorrect alarms and only gets triggered when individuals approach it.</p>
