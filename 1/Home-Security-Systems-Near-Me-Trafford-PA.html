<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, most burglar alarms work the exact very same way. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electric existing. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If someone were to unlock that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical existing to stream throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>
