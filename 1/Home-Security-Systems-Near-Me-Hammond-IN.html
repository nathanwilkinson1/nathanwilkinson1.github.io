<h2>Security Cameras, CCTV Systems, Alarms Hammond</h2>
<p>The implicit justification for the current push to increase video surveillance is the threat of terrorist attacks. However suicide assailants are clearly not prevented by video cameras - and might even be brought in to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the cost of a comprehensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up around 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget plan - far surpasses the restricted advantages that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact (see truth sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>The security systems I've developed and implemented are strictly for monitoring activity of a potential target, whether from a terrorist hazard or area burglars or vandals.

We have actually come across a couple of technical problems while long-term testing the Home Iota, and so will continue to evaluate and update accordingly. We no longer recommend it.</p>
