<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Likewise great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
