<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or home is the obligation of the whole community. Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first question you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The response hinges on a couple of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived footage you mean to keep and for how long you plan to keep recorded footage. If there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video is going to consume storage space rapidly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video footage as soon as you reach the system's capacity, but if you're not careful, the system may overwrite archived footage that you still need.</p>

Big bro? The Corporates? Or bugging neighbour? Who fixes a limit in between public interest and harassment? At the moment, no one! The camera might legally do what a peeping tom could not do. They could peer inside of windows with the full protection of the law on their side.

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
