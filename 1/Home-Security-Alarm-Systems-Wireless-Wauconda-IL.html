The Ring Floodlight Camera integrates 2 vital devices in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight. When the Floodlight camera detects motion, it switches on its two effective LED beams along with its sharp 1080p camera, and begins recording. The Floodlight Web cam also has a loud speaker, so you can speak with whoever remains in front of the camera, and hear their reactions. Outdoor cameras are among the best methods to discourage (and catch) robbers, vandals, and other miscreants. Like indoor security cameras, they can be incorporated as part of a home security system or used separately to up the security level around your home.</p>
