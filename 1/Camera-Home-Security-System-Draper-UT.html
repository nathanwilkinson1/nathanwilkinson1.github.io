<p>The basic pre-made security bundle from Frontpoint consists of a control panel, 3 door or window sensors, a motion sensing unit, a glass break sensor, and a keychain remote. You can add private products onto your system or create your system from scratch.

<p>You would be hard-pressed to discriminate in between 1080p and 4K resolution when taking a look at a normal camera image. The one major benefit of 4K resolution is the capability to solve information after the reality, which means that users can zoom in on information such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. However, while 4K resolution provides some benefits, it likewise brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are very large and take up a lot of taping storage space. So much, in truth, that they require about 4 times the disk drive space of 1080p to record the very same length of video footage. Be prepared to spend more cash if extended video storage is important.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
