<h3>Home Security Monitoring Service in New York</h3>
<p>Since it's more complex than it must be, we don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, alerts, and combination all need separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we frequently found action missing, thanks to lengthy and irregular gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the exact same area and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had actually installed on the deck by a licensed electrician (who happens to be my partner). All of the cameras were connected to the same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router inside your home (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to your home was Verizon Fios.</p>
