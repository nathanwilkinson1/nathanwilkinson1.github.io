Here is what this means, by way of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image throughout a far bigger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
