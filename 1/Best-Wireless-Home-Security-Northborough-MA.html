<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical since the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
