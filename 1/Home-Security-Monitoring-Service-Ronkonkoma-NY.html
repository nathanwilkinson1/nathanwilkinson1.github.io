<p>So, while alarm may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a total security bundle, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood must shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less break-ins throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more obvious. However, the reality that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute substantially to police ability to nab burglars makes the underwriting of alarm response by cops and whole communities (all taxpayers fund authorities response to alarmed properties) a inefficient and costly technique to burglary reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Self-monitored systems, like the majority of security systems, are offered online and are generally offered in packages.
