<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>

<p>This Arlo Pro 2 camera also works as a motion detector.

In addition, the motion sensing unit here is even more advanced than the ones provided by adobe Starter Set. Given that it is a PIR motion sensing unit, it just gets set off when it captures motion from something emitting infrared energy, i.e., animals and individuals. Additionally, it does not get triggered by small objects. As such, Arlo Pro 2 has among the most sophisticated motion sensing units that eliminate all incorrect alarms and only gets set off when individuals approach it.</p>

These cameras are true 1080p and work completely right out of package. They are well aligned and focused. The clarity is actually fantastic. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see respectable after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
