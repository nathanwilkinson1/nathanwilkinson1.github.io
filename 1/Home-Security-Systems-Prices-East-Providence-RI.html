<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Likewise good metal construction.

Should be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
