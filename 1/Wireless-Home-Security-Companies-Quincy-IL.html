<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
