Even if you run out power for days, the system must still have the ability to call for assistance. If someone cuts the phone line, though, you won't be able to utilize the system to call for aid.</p>
<p>This system employs an electro-magnetic field disruption concept based on two unshielded (or 'dripping') coax cables buried roughly 30 cm (1 feet) deep and 1 m (10 ft) apart. 6 The transmitter discharges constant Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable television and the energy is gotten by the other cable.

For each extra camera, the subscription is marked down to about half of the preliminary fee.
